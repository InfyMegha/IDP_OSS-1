## OVERVIEW

Infosys DevOps platform is centralized, simplified, automated and de-skilled. 

•	`Centralized` – IDP is a centrally hosted platform. 

•	`Simplified` – Simplified on boarding of applications. Since IDP is a platform based approach anybody can on board their application and start using it. We can on-board any number of applications to the same platform.  

•	`Automated` – IDP is integrated to open source, commercial and custom tools. For example to perform code analysis, tools like sonar cube , pmd, findbugs, checkstyle and to perform unit testing junit, to perform performance testing jmeter, to perform functional testing tools like selenium, protractor, RFT, Microsoft test manager  are integrated in the platform. In IDP there are currently 60 + tools integrated at the backend to perform these operations like code analysis, code coverage, functional testing, performance testing, unit testing etc.

•	`De-skilled` – In IDP there is no need of scripting or coding, since 60 + tools are integrated at the backend, tooling knowledge is not needed to setup a CICD pipeline

## IDP capabilities - 
Infosys DevOps platform is capable of supporting end to end CICD, CICT. 

# *Continuous integration* :– 
It involves CI practices like automating code analysis, white box, unit testing, code coverage data, running security scan to protect the IP in the code, and setting up tools in the ecosystem and so on. 

# *Continuous deployment* :- 
It supports CD operations that are deployed to multiple environments like cloud or frame or hybrid. CD also brings in mechanisms to gate deployment approval access, so that certain people will have certain abilities to deploy on certain environments.  

# *Continuous testing* :-
It supports CT operations like functional testing, performance testing, unit testing, security testing and service testing.
