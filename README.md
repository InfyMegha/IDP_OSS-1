# OVERVIEW

## Why DevOps Platform?
Global enterprises are undergoing Digital transformation journeys to transform their business. Being Digital requires Agile & DevOps at Scale to rapidly adopt new technologies, transform the legacy, innovate faster and respond swiftly to the ever changing customer needs
 
However, in scaling Agile & DevOps there are challenges that enterprises face:
*	Complexities due to multiple technologies including legacy
*	Fragmented, redundant tooling 
*	Multiple teams re-inventing the wheel
* Reduced visibility & governance 

Currently, there are limited solutions that are able to address these multi-dimensional challenges. Infosys recommends a platform based approach to scale distributed agile & devops

## Why Infosys DevOps Platform?

Infosys DevOps Platform is the best enterprise class integrated open source platform that helps organizations accelerate their Agile and DevOps Transformation journey – with quality, at speed and at scale. 

The platform provides the visibility to drive smarter software delivery while ensuring DevOps adoption at Scale. It also provides reliability & security for the application teams. As the platform is built on Open Source technologies and also available as Open Source, it enables faster innovation and co-creation across the ecosystem - including clients, DevOps practitioners, technology partners and developer community. 

We help enterprise clients establish the right level of collaboration among the development, testing and operations teams while automating the entire process of software delivery. We offer tools agnostic and technologies agnostic approach to cater to the needs of enterprise teams - across legacy, native digital and hybrid delivery models. 

With Infosys DevOps Platform, our clients have achieved reduction of build and deployment cycle times by upto 50%, near to zero environment issues, and improved application quality.

Our platform is based on five foundational business value pillars:



1.	**Accelerate**:
Provide a self-service model to all teams to be able to rapidly on-board their applications into a pre-configured continuous integration, testing & delivery workflow. This accelerates the business outcomes planned through higher productivity and quicker innovation cycles by application teams

2.	**Automate**:
Drive the team towards a scriptless Automation first culture. This enables the teams to track any artifact through its lifecycle right from development to production with an assurance to achieve continuous deployment when necessary 

3.	**Scale**:
Offer a tool agnostic approach to scale the enterprise teams through pre-configured pipelines across 20+ Technologies & 60+ Tools in all major areas – COTS (SAP, Oracle, PEGA & others), BI/Big DATA, Legacy, Custom S/W & Cloud technologies

4.	**Visualize**:
Present real-time visibility through Insights on process and code across value streams facilitating right decision making across stakeholders. This also helps Business teams relay the end-user feedback on the applications and services

5.	**Secure**:
Role based DevOps workflows with multi-tenancy and encrypted jobs offers complete security on Cloud / On-Premise infrastructure that maintains data privacy for critical applications and uncover vulnerabilities much early in the lifecycle through integrations with QA tools
